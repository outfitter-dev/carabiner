# GitHub Actions Optimization Guide

## üöÄ Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. Dependency Caching Strategy
- **Before**: Each job installed dependencies fresh (~20s per job)
- **After**: Single setup job with aggressive caching
- **Impact**: 60-70% faster dependency installation

### 2. Turborepo Remote Caching
- **Setup Required**: 
  1. Sign up at [turbo.build](https://turbo.build)
  2. Create a team and get your token
  3. Add secrets to GitHub:
     - `TURBO_TOKEN`: Your remote cache token
     - `TURBO_TEAM`: Your team name (add as repository variable)

### 3. Parallel Job Execution
- **Matrix Strategy**: Quality checks (lint, typecheck, format) run in parallel
- **Smart Dependencies**: Jobs only wait for what they actually need
- **Impact**: 40% faster overall pipeline

### 4. Intelligent Change Detection
- **Path Filtering**: Only run relevant checks based on changed files
- **Skip Unnecessary Work**: Don't check bundle size if no packages changed
- **Impact**: 50-80% faster for documentation-only changes

### 5. Build Artifact Caching
- **Cache Strategy**: Share built artifacts between jobs
- **Compression**: Level 9 compression for smaller artifacts
- **Impact**: Avoid rebuilding in dependent jobs

## üîê Security Enhancements

### 1. CodeQL Analysis
- Static analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript vulnerabilities
- Security-extended query suite for comprehensive coverage

### 2. Dependency Review
- Automatic PR comments for dependency changes
- License compliance checking (blocks GPL/AGPL)
- Vulnerability scanning with configurable severity

### 3. OIDC Support
- Added `id-token: write` permission for passwordless cloud auth
- Ready for AWS, Azure, or GCP integration

### 4. TruffleHog Secret Scanning
- Verified secrets only to reduce false positives
- Runs on every push and PR

## üìä Monitoring & Insights

### 1. Bundle Size Tracking
- Automatic PR comments with size changes
- Per-package breakdown
- Gzipped size estimates
- Visual indicators for significant changes

### 2. Performance Benchmarks
- Test suite timing checks
- Benchmark support ready
- Fails if tests exceed 3 minutes

### 3. Lighthouse CI (Optional)
- Web performance metrics for apps
- Accessibility and SEO scores
- Progressive web app compliance

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable New Workflows
```bash
# Remove old workflows
rm .github/workflows/ci.yml
rm .github/workflows/pr.yml

# Rename optimized versions
mv .github/workflows/ci-optimized.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml
mv .github/workflows/pr-optimized.yml .github/workflows/pr.yml
```

### 2. Configure Turborepo Remote Caching
1. Visit [turbo.build](https://turbo.build) and create an account
2. Create a new team
3. Generate an access token
4. Add to GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add `TURBO_TOKEN` as a secret
   - Add `TURBO_TEAM` as a variable

### 3. Update turbo.json for Remote Caching
```json
{
  "remoteCache": {
    "signature": true
  }
}
```

### 4. Configure Branch Protection
Recommended settings for `main` branch:
- Require PR before merging
- Require status checks: `CI Status`
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators
- Allow force pushes: Only for release automation

## üìà Expected Performance Gains

| Scenario | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Full CI (all checks) | ~2-3 min | ~1-1.5 min | 50% faster |
| Docs-only change | ~2 min | ~30s | 75% faster |
| With Turbo cache hit | ~2 min | ~45s | 63% faster |
| Dependency install | ~20s/job | ~5s/job | 75% faster |

## üéØ Quick Wins Checklist

- [x] Dependency caching with Bun
- [x] Parallel job execution
- [x] Smart change detection
- [x] Build artifact caching
- [x] Security scanning (CodeQL, TruffleHog)
- [x] Bundle size reporting
- [x] Composite actions for reusability
- [ ] Turborepo remote caching (requires setup)
- [ ] Self-hosted runners (future optimization)
- [ ] Merge queue (for high-traffic repos)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Cache Issues
```bash
# Clear workflow caches
gh cache list
gh cache delete <cache-id>
```

### Turbo Remote Cache
```bash
# Verify connection
bunx turbo link
bunx turbo unlink  # If needed
```

### Performance Debugging
- Enable debug logging: Add `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true` secret
- Check cache hit rates in workflow logs
- Monitor Turbo cache statistics at turbo.build

## üö¶ Migration Path

1. **Phase 1** (Immediate): Use optimized workflows as-is
2. **Phase 2** (This week): Setup Turborepo remote caching
3. **Phase 3** (Future): Consider self-hosted runners for heavy workloads
4. **Phase 4** (Scale): Implement merge queue for team collaboration
