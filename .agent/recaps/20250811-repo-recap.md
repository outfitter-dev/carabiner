# Repository Recap - August 11, 2025

## tl;dr
Massive architecture transformation day. Implemented Phase 3 execution engine and Phase 4 plugin architecture, followed by complete namespace migration from @claude-code to @outfitter. Day ended with extensive build system fixes and type safety resolution after the breaking changes.

### Architecture Milestones
- **Phase 3 Execution**: Implemented simplified execution engine replacing legacy hook runtime
- **Phase 4 Plugins**: Complete plugin architecture for extensible hook behaviors
- **Namespace Migration**: Systematic migration from @claude-code to @outfitter across all packages

### Breaking Changes Management
- **TypeScript Fixes**: Multiple rounds of compilation error resolution across packages
- **Build System**: Added composite TypeScript settings for monorepo stability
- **Package Disabling**: Temporarily disabled broken plugins package to maintain build stability
- **Type Safety**: Resolved all ultracite violations for strict compliance

### Documentation & Configuration
- **README Updates**: All documentation updated to reflect @outfitter namespace
- **CI Configuration**: Removed test sharding and fixed TypeScript exhaustive checks
- **Code Review**: Addressed critical issues from comprehensive code review

## Anomalies Detected
- **High Change Volume**: 12 commits in single day indicates intensive refactoring
- **Breaking Changes**: Namespace migration required extensive cross-package fixes
- **Build Instability**: Multiple TypeScript compilation fixes suggest complex dependency challenges

## What's Next
Architecture transformation complete but stability needs attention. Build system partially disabled (plugins package). Focus should shift to incremental fixes and re-enabling disabled components.
