## Architecture Transformation

### Before (Complex)

```typescript
// 477 lines of complex generics
type HookContext<TEvent extends HookEvent, TTool extends ToolName> = TEvent extends
  | 'PreToolUse'
  | 'PostToolUse'
  ? BaseContext & ToolContext<TTool>
  : TEvent extends 'UserPromptSubmit'
  ? BaseContext & UserPromptContext
  : BaseContext;

// Complex builder pattern
new HookBuilder<'PreToolUse', 'Bash'>()
  .forEvent('PreToolUse')
  .forTool('Bash')
  .withHandler(handler)
  .withMiddleware(m1)
  .withMiddleware(m2)
  .build();
```

### After (Simple)

```typescript
// Simple concrete types
interface BashPreToolUseContext {
  event: 'PreToolUse';
  toolName: 'Bash';
  toolInput: BashInput;
  sessionId: SessionId;
}

// Simple plugin
export const gitSafetyPlugin: HookPlugin = {
  name: 'git-safety',
  version: '1.0.0',
  events: ['PreToolUse'],
  apply(context) {
    if (context.toolName !== 'Bash') return { success: true };
    // Simple logic
    return { success: true };
  },
};
```

## Package Structure

```
packages/
├── @outfitter/types          # Core type definitions
├── @outfitter/schemas         # Runtime validation
├── @outfitter/protocol        # I/O abstraction
├── @outfitter/execution       # Execution engine
├── @outfitter/registry        # Plugin system

```

## Example: Complete Hook System

```typescript
// hooks.config.ts
export default {
  plugins: [
    { name: 'git-safety', enabled: true, priority: 100 },
    { name: 'file-backup', enabled: true, priority: 50 },
    { name: 'security-scanner', enabled: true, priority: 75 },
  ],
  rules: {
    'git-safety': {
      blockPatterns: ['--force', 'reset --hard'],
    },
  },
};

// main.ts
import { createPluginSystem } from '@outfitter/registry';
import { StdinProtocol } from '@outfitter/protocol';
import { HookExecutor } from '@outfitter/execution';

async function main() {
  const system = await createPluginSystem('./hooks.config.ts');
  const protocol = new StdinProtocol();
  const executor = new HookExecutor(protocol, {
    handler: async (context) => system.registry.execute(context),
  });

  await executor.run();
}

main();
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
